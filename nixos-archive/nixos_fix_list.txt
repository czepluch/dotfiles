NixOS fix list
- Power management
- AMD driver (potentially rollback changes in config)
- Monitor refresh rate (dynamic)
- fingerprint unlock
- bluelight hyprsunet reconfig
- easy switch power profile, on battery use low power for battery life (done), but we need to fix that we switch to performance when needed
- IR camera setup continued (howdy add) (doesn't work for now)
